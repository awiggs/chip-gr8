# Introduction

Project page dedicated to the demonstration and information of fourth year design project.

~~We are currently in project planning phase so stay tuned for future updates!~~

<Insert some text explaining how we're fourth year engineering students making our capstone project and decided to create Chip-Gr8>

# About
(Might want to move this section either to the About Page or just have this as a brief summary?)

The project pertains to the design and implementation of a Chip-8 emulator and AI research environment. We hope to design a high performance emulation engine with a Python API for integration with modern Machine Learning and AI libraries. Future work would be to add more architectures to the emulator.

# Timeline

Below is a general timeline describing how the project evolved from the beginning, May 2019, of the course until its final stages of development, August 2019. Intimate technical details are omitted in this timeline; it is only focused on the general technical achievements and project milestones.  Additionally, no project details are included in this timeline that do not pertain to the Chip-Gr8 application (i.e. no report details, etc.).

Project set to be completed by August 9th, 2019.
